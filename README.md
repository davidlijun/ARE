Investment Framework & Analytical Architecture

**Universe:** North American Equities  & Global (EAFE & EM)

Executive Summary
------------------------

The **Alpha Risk Engine (ARE)** is a systematic framework designed to manage a concentrated **high-conviction** portfolio through the lens of institutional risk management.

By integrating **Fundamental Equity Research** (Alpha) with **Quantitative Factor Modeling** (Risk), ARE aims to achieve risk-adjusted outperformance while mitigating tail-risks associated with cyclical infrastructure buildouts (e.g., AI/NAND cycles) and macroeconomic shocks.

Directory Architecture
-------------------------

The engine is organized into six functional modules:

```Table
/ARE_Project_Root

├── alpha_research/            # Fundamental deep-dives (GIL Mergers, SNDK Cycle Analysis)
├── data_pipeline/             # Python scripts for IBKR TWS API & YFinance data ingestion
├── risk_modeling/             # Factor-based risk engines (Fama-French, Ledoit-Wolf, CVaR)
├── optimization/              # Black-Litterman & Mean-Variance Optimization models
├── governance_ips/            # Investment Policy Statement (IPS) & Decision Logs (Minutes)
└── reporting_attribution/     # GIPS-compliant performance & Brinson attribution reports

Quantitative Methodologies
--------------------------

ARE utilizes institutional-grade Python libraries to execute the following models:

* Robust Covariance: Utilizing Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage to stabilize the covariance matrix and solve the "Suboptimal Benchmark" ($\rho$ > 1) problem.

* Factor Attribution: A global multi-factor model decompose returns into Market ($\beta$), Size (SMB), and Value (HML) exposures.

* Tail Risk Analysis: Calculating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to account for non-normal distributions in tech-heavy positions (SNDK).

* Black-Litterman Allocation: Blending market equilibrium weights with analyst-specific views on GIL (Post-Merger Value) and SNDK (Infrastructure Peak).

Current Strategic Views (2026 Q2)
---------------------------------

* AI Infrastructure Cycle: Underweight hardware (SNDK) due to anticipated saturation of the CAPEX supercycle; pivot to software/services (GOOG).

* Apparel/Basics Integration: Overweight GIL based on vertical integration efficiencies and HanesBrands synergy capture.

* Defensive Core: Utilization of FBAL and XDIV to maintain a lower-volatility systematic floor during geopolitical volatility.

Operational Governance
-----------------------

* Execution Desk: All trades are executed via broker utilizing Single Login System (SLS) for Joint/Individual account consolidation.

* Decision Logging: Every rebalancing event requires a written entry in the `governance_ips` folder to mitigate behavioral bias.

* Tax Efficiency: Prioritization of "In-Kind" transfers to minimize capital gains drag on long-term "winners."

How to use this README
-----------------------------

1. **Identity:** As an analyst, this doc is your "Anchor." When the market is volatile (like **MSFT**'s current weakness), read Section 1 and Section 4 to remind yourself of the strategy.
2. **Governance:** If you decide to sell **MCD**, you must first record the reason in the `governance_ips` folder mentioned in the README.
3. **Onboarding:** If you ever decide to hire a junior analyst or a partner, this README serves as the "Instruction Manual" for how your fund operates.
